## Description
The Funpay Spider is a web scraper built with Scrapy that extracts information about lots on the [https://funpay.com/](https://funpay.com/) marketplace. The spider prompts the user to enter the URL of the lot they want information about and then scrapes data from the lot's page, including the username of the seller, the price of the lot, the unit of the price, the amount of items the seller has for sale, the description of the lot, the number of 5-star ratings the seller has received, and whether the seller is on-site or off-site.
